# CREATURE MATH FIGHTER

So this is a real actual thing, but it is also mostly an experiment and a test-bed for `rpgstat` + `fltk-form` + `serde` + random things.

If you like Pokemon interfaces for battles that make you do a random equation and some based on the formula used to damage your opponent, this is it.

Of course all the creatures are libre, and will be more and more randomly generated as I am able to put in the work.

Currently names are completely random syllable-based names.  It produces fairly consistent names, though I do not know every language on the planet, so it may inadvertantly produce words I do not know the meaning of.  I would be glad to remove/change syllable combinations if it becomes clear they are desired to be changed.
